4. Core Modules
- Admin Dashboard – FDP management, payments, bulk communication, certificate templates, analytics.
- FDP Events Page – Public listing of all FDPs with registration forms.
- Payment Integration – Cashfree API for host and faculty payments.
- Communication – Nodemailer for email, WhatsApp Cloud API for messages.
- Attendance & Feedback – Collected via Zoom/Google Meet API or Google Forms.
- Certificate Generation – HTML template + Puppeteer/wkhtmltopdf for PDF export.
5. Certificate Template Integration
Certificates will be generated dynamically using a standard HTML/PDF template. The template will support placeholders that are replaced with participant data. Placeholders include:
- {{participant_name}}
- {{college_name}}
- {{fdp_title}}
- {{fdp_dates}}
- {{organiser_logo}}
- {{college_logo}}
- {{signature_image}}
The certificate design will include both the organiser's logo and the host college's logo, with digital signature images for authenticity. Generated certificates will be sent via email and WhatsApp without requiring eSign or DSC integration.
