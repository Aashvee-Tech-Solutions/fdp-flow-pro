## 🚀 How to Run

### For Development (Replit)

1. **Configure environment variables** (already set in `.env`):
   - Database, email, WhatsApp, payment credentials

2. **Run frontend and backend together**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:full
   ```

   OR run separately:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Frontend (port 5000)
   npm run dev

   # Terminal 2 - Backend (port 3000)
   npm run dev:backend
   ```

3. **Access**:
   - Frontend: https://your-replit-url (port 5000)
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000/api

### For Export to Other Hosting

The system is **100% portable** and can run on:
- Vercel/Netlify (Frontend) + Railway/Render (Backend)
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- AWS EC2 + RDS
- Heroku
- Any VPS with Node.js and PostgreSQL

See `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.
